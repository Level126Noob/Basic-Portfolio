    <p>Hi, I'm travis! I'm 26 years old and I work in sheet metal manufacturing which is a family bussiness. I handle production, tool & die, and some machinist work. It's a good job and I truly enjoy mechanics but my true passion is technology! Outside of work you can usually catch me playing video games, bowling, or hanging out with my friends. The main video games I play would be Pokemon GO, Destiny 2, Smash Brawl, Rivals of Aether, old school runescape. I'm an affiliate on twitch for streaming old school runescape. It was my career before getting thrown into the family factory, but it didn't necessarily pay the bills! Before all this I played varsity soccer for North Ridgeville Highschool, transfered to Rocky River High School, and graduated through ECOT.</p>
